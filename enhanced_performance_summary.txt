# Enhanced Algorithm Performance Summary

## Test Results on Synthetic Videos:

### Subtle Flicker (realistic flash intensity):
- Original algorithm: 50.6% reduction (0.015 → 0.008 FI)
- Enhanced median: 50.6% reduction, SSIM: 0.746
- Enhanced flashcap: -13.4% (over-corrected this type)

### Rapid Strobe (15Hz epilepsy-trigger pattern):
- Enhanced flashcap: 96.0% reduction (253 → 10 FI) ✨
- Enhanced median: 0.8% reduction (poor for rapid alternation)

## Recommendations for Real Videos:

### Use enhanced_flashcap for:
- Rapid strobing/flashing (>5Hz)
- High-contrast flashes
- Epilepsy-trigger content
- Animation with bright effects

### Use enhanced_median for:
- Isolated bright flashes
- Camera flashes
- Explosion effects
- Single-frame brightness spikes

### Use enhanced_ema for:
- General temporal smoothing
- Motion-heavy content
- Gradual brightness variations
- Content with camera movement

## Improved Parameters:
- Flash threshold lowered to 0.03-0.05 (was 0.12)
- Percentile-based detection (90th percentile vs mean)
- Spatial awareness and motion compensation
- Adaptive window sizing
